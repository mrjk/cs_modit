## Be sane:

* I don't want to manage mod inter-dependencies
* I don't want my game to crash
* I don't want to use deprecated mods
* I don't want complicated or boring things to do


## Manage my mods:

* I want to have a list of my favorite mods
* I want to be able to see them by type (mod, asset, map) and categories (vehicle, prop, building, ...)
* I want to be able to arrange them in subfolders (grouping feature)
* I want to be able to load a custom mod listing XML file to load my mod
* I want to be able to detect which mod potentially broke my game
